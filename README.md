# IFC 4.3 - Utils
This is the **utility repository** for the testing and validation process of the IFC 4.3. It contains production schema that is subject for testing, source code and other utils used to generate IFC files. 

## How the repository is structured
* The folder "schema" contains production schema based on offical releases of IFC, e.g. IFC4x3_RC2. Updates are documented in the change log.
* The folder "src" contains source code for producing IFC files. They are packaged based on different subjects. For example, the subfolder "EnrichIFC4x3" contains source code to enrich IFC alignment semantics with geometry data.
