# IFC 4.3 - Utils
This is the **utility repository** for the testing and validation process of the IFC 4.3. It contains source code and synthetic cases for IFC 4.3 files. 

## How the repository is structured
* src: contains source code for producing IFC files. To be updated
* alignment_testset: compiled applications for enriching IFC 4.3 alignment (add geometry based on business logic), checking alignment consistentency (compare geometry with business logic), and generating pointlist. It also has a set of test files that covers all different types of alignment segments.
