# IFC 4.3 - Utils
This is the **utility repository** for the testing and validation process of the IFC 4.3. It contains source code and synthetic cases for IFC 4.3 files. 

## How the repository is structured
* The folder "src" contains source code for producing IFC files. They are packaged based on different subjects. For example, the subfolder "EnrichIFC4x3" contains source code to enrich IFC alignment semantics with geometry data.
